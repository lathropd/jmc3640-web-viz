        <h5>Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?</h5>
        <p>
          Carrie, Moss! First scene in Carrie! Oh. Okay Today I have a business empire the like of which the world has
          never seen the like of which.
        </p>
        <p>
           I hope it doesn't sound arrogant when I say that I am the greatest man in the
          world! No, that's the music you hear when... I'm sorry are you from the past? Today I have a business empire
          the like of which the world has never seen the like of which. I hope it doesn't sound arrogant when I say that
          I am the greatest man in the world! 0115... no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency
          services? Then which country am I speaking to? Hello? Hello? A gay musical, called Gay. That's quite gay. Gay
          musical? Aren't all musicals gay? This must be, like, the gayest musical ever.
        </p>

        <h5>Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot?</h5>
        <p>
          You can come down here any time and I'll be waiting for you! [slams down phone] That told her! No, no, that's
          the music you heard when it come on. Graphic homoeroticism? Does that mean they're going to get them out?
        </p>
        <p>
         I am a man, he's a man, we're men! Ok, tell me how
          your
          feeling. I feel delicate... and annoyed, and... I think I'm ugly. Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and
          on again?
        </p>
        <p>
          You know, it's high tide. But we're not on the coast. I'm closed for maintenance! Closed for maintenance?
          I've fallen to the communists! Well, they do have some strong arguments. I'm going to murder you... You bloody
          woman! Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with
          viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken
          AGAIN! Carrie, Moss! First scene in Carrie! Oh. Okay You can come down here any time and I'll be waiting for
          you! [slams down phone] That told her! Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot?
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll put this over here, with the rest of the fire. How long have you been disabled? Ten years? Ten years,
          and how did it happen? If that's not a rude question. Acid? While he was eating, did you hear anyone laughing?
          Like... in the kitchen area? Yes! Yes I did, actually, yes I did. That'd be trouser food! Oh really? Then why
          don't you come down and make me then. You know, it's high tide. But we're not on the coast. I'm closed for
          maintenance! Closed for maintenance? I've fallen to the communists! Well, they do have some strong arguments.
          Oh really? Then why don't you come down and make me then.
        </p>
        <p>
          0115... no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency services? Then which country am I
          speaking to? Hello? Hello? They just toss us away like yesterday's jam. No, no there you go, no there you
          go. I just heard it come on. A gay musical, called Gay. That's quite gay. Gay musical? Aren't all musicals
          gay? This must be, like, the gayest musical ever. Might want to play a bit hard to get. I'm going to murder
          you... You bloody woman!

        <h5>Are you ready for the truth?</h5>
        <p>
          The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of
          evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of
          darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon
          thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And
          you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>

          Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while
          I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it
          don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it
          over to your dumb ass. </p>

        <h5>Hold on to your butts</h5>
        <p>
          Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name
          printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
          mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store.
          And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>

          Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than
          mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way
          to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem,
          we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

        <h5>Is she dead, yes or no?</h5>
        <p>
          Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw
          Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to
          me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>

          Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know
          how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times
          they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the
          kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>
